Widgets are snippets of html that can be embedded on your site to provide Book E Commerce and Digital eBook Fulfillment capabilities.  Currently Widgets are not self-service.  We help customize styles to your site and provide you with setup details tailored to your application.  All or none of your site can be hosted in our Cloud.  To begin, check out [[Getting Started]].  Then proceed to each Widget to learn more about using Widgets on your site.
